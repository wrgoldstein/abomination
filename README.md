This is

1. the basic result of `dbt init`, with local postgres as the backend
2. the addition of a python model
3. the hackery involved to run the dbt models outside dbt
4. including python in containers

These models

```
models
â””â”€â”€ example
    â”œâ”€â”€ my_first_dbt_model.sql
    â”œâ”€â”€ my_second_dbt_model.sql
    â”œâ”€â”€ python_model.py         <-- ooh
    â””â”€â”€ schema.yml
macros
â””â”€â”€ my_py_func.py
```

can be run with 

```
python wirtl run
```

but not 

```
dbt run
```
